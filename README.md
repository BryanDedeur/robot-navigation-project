## Robot Navigation Project
Purpose: to simulate LiDAR sensor readings in occupancy grid to help a robot navigate through a 2D environment

## How to compile and execute this project

For Linux:

Installation
> must run cmake to generate makefile

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/BryanDudeInWater/robot-navigation-project.git
cd [parent-directory]/robot-navigation
cmake .
make
```

Execution
> after running 'make' a series of executables will be available for each part of the project. Simply use

```cmd
./robot-navigation
```

## LiDAR to Occupancy Grid Calculation Approach

The LiDAR will cast 13 rays in the direction of the robot that will return a reading if an area is occupied or not. The length of each beam will have a max range of 50 units from its origin. Each ray being 15 degrees apart we can use this approach for calculating the individual points of interest that a beam will pass through.

Let l = the length of the ray as it is casted

we can simply find the grid points of length 1-50 at any angle by (cos(theta)xl, sin(theta)xl). Since those coordinates will contain a decimal we can round both the x and y off to find the nearest coordinate to occupy. And since these calculations will return negative numbers we also need to find the absolute values.

Let d = the direction of the robot

we only care about the readings in-front of the robot and to the sides (the direction + or - 90 degrees)

sudo code

```cpp
// for (theta = direction - 90; until theta >= direction + 90; theta = theta + 15 ) {
//  for (length = 1; until length == 50 or collides with something; length++) {
//    coordinate point x = round(abs((cos(theta) * length)));
//    coordinate point y = round(abs((sin(theta) * length)));
//  }
// }
```
