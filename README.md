## Robot Navigation Project
Purpose: to simulate LiDAR sensor readings in occupancy grid to help a robot navigate through a 2D environment

## How to compile and execute this project

For Linux:

Installation
> must run cmake to generate makefile

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/BryanDudeInWater/robot-navigation-project.git
cd [parent-directory]/robot-navigation
cmake .
make
```
Compilation
> type these command in terminal in directory where the files are located. If cmake says the current version doesn't meet the minimum required cmake version, change cmake version from 3.12 to 3.x (where x is the cmake version your computer supports)

```
cmake .
make
```

Execution
> executables are placed in the bin directory. Navigate to the bin directory with command

```
cd bin
```

> after running 'make' a series of executables will be available for each part of the project.

```cmd
./robot-navigation
```

## Results

The output of the data is represented on a portable pixel map (.ppm) image file containing RGB color values for every pixel location.
- Black pixels = occupied positions
- Red pixels = robot positions
- Grey pixels = ray casted probability approximations for occupied positions

## LiDAR to Occupancy Grid Calculation Approach

The LiDAR will cast 13 rays in the direction of the robot that will return a reading if an area is occupied or not. The length of each beam will have a max range of 50 units from its origin. Each ray being 15 degrees apart we can use this approach for calculating the individual points of interest that a beam will pass through.

Let l = the length of the ray as it is casted

we can simply find the grid points of length 1-50 at any angle by (cos(theta)*l, sin(theta)*l). Since those coordinates will contain a decimal we can round both the x and y off to find the nearest coordinate to occupy. And since these calculations will return negative numbers we also need to find the absolute values.

Let d = the direction of the robot

we only care about the readings in-front of the robot and to the sides (the direction + or - 90 degrees)

sudo code

```cpp
// for (theta = direction - 90; until theta >= direction + 90; theta = theta + 15 ) {
//  for (length = 1; until length == 50 or collides with something; length++) {
//    coordinate point x = round(abs((cos(theta) * length)));
//    coordinate point y = round(abs((sin(theta) * length)));
//  }
// }
```
